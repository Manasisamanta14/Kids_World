<h2>Read all about Kids-world here</h2>
<h3>the facade of the webshop Kids-world</h3>

Kids-world is one of Denmark's largest online store within kids' clothing, shoes, toys and interior.<br>
 design for kids Kids-world was founded back in 2006 and employ more than 160 people today.<br>
In 2018 we received the award "E-handelsprisen - Brugernes Favorit".
In 2018 we received the award "Børn i byen - Årets Forretning".

<h3>Vision</h3>
"We wish to be the preferred shopping universe for families with 
kids by offering everything from clothes and shoes to toys."

<h3>Our mission</h3>
To create an amazing shopping universe with everything for babies, kids and teenagers,
where the customers can sense that there are real people behind the screens.

We want to offer our customers the best shopping experience, where they can sense that
 they shop from people, and not just an online shop. To have a good relationship with
<br> our customers is therefore a necessity to us, not only as a business, but also as human beings.

Therefore, our highest priority will always be to provide excellent service to our customers, 
<br>that is both personal, positive and solution-oriented at the same time.

<h3>Our working responsibilities include:</h3>

to inspire the customers by always being first movers with the latest collections.
to be attentive, and be inspired by what our customers suggest and think. Thus, 
<br>we are always up to date on latest trends and can offer the most attractive 
brands from Denmark as well as internationally.
to transfer our great product knowledge to the customers, whether that happens 
<br>during a dialogue with our customer service, when reading a product description,
 or using our size guides, etc.

<h3>Values</h3>
Our common values in Kids-world are to be receptive, ambitious and meet the customers 
<br>where they are. Our values are present in what we are, what we stand for and the way we work.

Respect for ourselves and others - We are passionate and put the heart into every aspect of our job.
<br> Thus, we wish to be true to ourselves in what we do, and always give a professional and present service.
Respect for different preferences - We put a lot of effort into offering different product types, textiles,
<br> qualities, styles and colours, so that each and everyone can find something to their liking.
Respect for the future - We have incorporated environmental consciousness into our processes and we 
<br>try to optimize these continuously, along with our consumption, with respect for our future.

<h3>Kids-world was founded in Esbjerg</h3>
Back in 2006 Kids-world was founded in Esbjerg by Annette Lykke Nielsen and Jesper Klit Johansen. 
The idea behind Kids-world arose as the couple lacked a web shop that could offer a modern and
<br> wide choice of kids’ clothing, while offering excellent customer service. Since the foundation,
 the couple has had the vision to become the preferred shopping universe for families with kids
<br> when it comes to clothing, shoes, toys, interior and gear for kids.


<h3>A versatile team</h3>
Our administration and warehouse is located in Esbjerg, and the team exists of skilled customer 
<br>service representatives, developers, warehouse personnel and other employees - all with the
 aim to provide our loyal customers the ultimate shopping experience.<br>

We are always looking for talented people to join our team. Interested in joining our team?
